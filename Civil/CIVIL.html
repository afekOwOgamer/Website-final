        <h1 class="titleBox">Civil aviation</h1>

        <p class="textBox">Civil aviation is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-military and non-state aviation, both private and commercial. Most of the countries in the world are members of the International Civil Aviation Organization and work together to establish common standards and recommended practices for civil aviation through that agency.</p>

        <div class="textBox">
            <p>Civil aviation includes three major categories:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Commercial air transport, including scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Aerial work, in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, photography, surveying, search, rescue, etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>General aviation, including all other civil flights, private or commercial.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="textBox">Although scheduled air transport is the larger operation in terms of passenger numbers, General aviation is larger in the number of flights In the U.S., General aviation carries 166 million passengers each year, more than any individual airline, though less than all the airlines combined. Since 2004, the US Airlines combined have carried over 600 million passengers each year, and in 2014, they carried a combined 662,819,232 passengers.</p>

        <div class="textBox">
            <p>Some countries also make a regulatory distinction based on whether aircraft are flown for hire like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Commercial aviation includes most or all flying done for hire, particularly scheduled service on airlines</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Private aviation includes pilots flying for their own purposes (recreation, business meetings, etc.) without receiving any kind of remuneration.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="textBox">
            <p>All scheduled air transport is commercial, but general aviation can be either commercial or private. Normally, the pilot, aircraft, and operator must all be authorized to perform commercial operations through separate commercial licensing, registration, and operation certificates.</p>
            <p>Non-civil aviation is referred to as state aviation. This includes military aviation, state VIP transports, and police/customs aircraft.</p>
            <h3 class="titleBox">Post war</h3>
            <p>After World War II, commercial aviation grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military pilots to transport people and cargo. Factories that had produced bombers were quickly adapted to the production of passenger aircraft like the Douglas DC-4. This growth was accelerated by the establishment of military airports throughout the world, either for combat use or training. These could easily be turned to civil aviation use. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British de Havilland Comet. By 1952, the British state airline BOAC had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While it was a technical achievement, the airplane suffered a series of highly public failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to metal fatigue. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs such as the Boeing 707 had already entered service.</p>
            <h3 class="titleBox">Civil aviation authorities</h3>
            <p>The Convention on International Civil Aviation also known as the &quot;Chicago Convention&quot; was originally established in 1944. it states that signatories should collectively work to harmonize and standardize the use of airspace for safety, efficiency, and regularity of air transport. Each signatory country, of which there are at least 193, has a civil aviation authority (such as the FAA in the United States) to oversee the following areas of civil aviation. Also, federal administration relies on 99.99%</p>

            <ul>

        </div>
        <h3 class="titleBox">Statistics</h3>
        <p class="textBox">
            The World Bank lists monotonously growing numbers for the number of passengers transported per year worldwide with a preliminary all-time high in 2015 of 3.44 billion passengers.
            Likewise, the number of registered carrier departures worldwide has reached a peak in 2015 with almost 33 million takeoffs.
            In the US alone, the passenger miles "computed by summing the products of the aircraft-miles flown on each inter airport segment multiplied by the number of passengers carried on that segment" have reached 607,772 million miles (978,114×106 km) in 2014 (as compared to highway car traffic with 4,371,706 million miles (7,035,579×106 km)).
            The global seasonally adjusted revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) per month peaked at more than 550 billion kilometers (3,700 AU) (~6.6 trillion per year, corresponding to roughly 2000 km per passenger) in January 2016, a 7% rise over one year.
            The passenger numbers are distinctively more volatile than general economic indicators. Global political, economic, or health crises have an amplifying effect.
