            <p>
                The Military has a designation system for aircraft of all types. each letter represents a thing by the next pattern:
            </p>
            <h4>
                (Status Prefix)(Modified Mission)(Basic Mission)-(Design Number)(Series Letter)
            </h4>
            <p>
                Of these components, only the Basic Mission, Design Number and Series Letter are a must. In the case of special vehicles a Vehicle Type symbol must also be included.
            </p>

            Design number - According to the designation system, aircraft of a particular vehicle type or basic mission were to be numbered consecutively. Numbers were not to be assigned to avoid confusion with other letter sequences or to conform with manufacturers' model numbers.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="titleBox">
            Series letter - Different versions of the same basic aircraft type are to be delineated using a single letter suffix beginning with "A" and increasing sequentially, skipping "I" and "O" to avoid confusion with the numbers "1" and "0". The modification of an aircraft to carry out a new mission does not necessarily require a new suffix, but often a new letter is assigned.
