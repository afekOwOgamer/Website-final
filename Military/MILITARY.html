                Military aviation is one of the most supreme and technologically advanced industries in the world. As a result, the aviation branch in most military forces is considered luxurious and top class. With extremely grueling tests and high standards. Military aircraft can be split into multiple categories. Ranging from slow-speed attackers to high-speed fighter jets and bombers. Military aviation comprises military aircraft and other flying vehicles for the purposes of conducting aerial warfare and military airlift, enabling the ability to provide logistical support to forces stationed in active war zones.

                The air force is a branch of a nation's armed forces that is mainly responsible for its aviation and aerial warfare. Most nations either maintain an air force or, in the case of smaller and less developed countries, an air wing. Air forces are usually tasked with the air defense of a country, as well as:

        <h3 class="titleBox">strategic bombing</h3>

        <p class="textBox">A military strategy used in total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale, its economic ability to produce and transport material to the active warzones or military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize bombers, missiles, or nuclear-armed aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.</p>
        <h3 class="titleBox">Tactical bombing</h3>

        <p class="textBox">Aerial bombing is aimed at targets of immediate military value, such as combatants, military installations, or military equipment. This is in contrast to strategic bombing, or attacking enemy cities and factories to cripple future military production and enemy civilians' will to support the war effort, to debilitate the enemy's long-term capacity to wage war.</p>

        <h3 class="titleBox">interdiction</h3>

        <p class="textBox">The act of delaying, disrupting or destroying enemy forces or supplies route to the battle area. A distinction is often made between strategic and tactical interdiction. The former refers to operations whose effects are broad and long-term; tactical operations are designed to affect events rapidly and in a localized area.</p>

        <h3 class="titleBox">close air support</h3>

        <p class="textBox">Close air support (CAS) is an attack by an aircraft against hostile targets near friendly forces and require detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces and attacks with aerial bombs, glide bombs, missiles, rockets, autocannons, machine guns, and even directed-energy weapons such as lasers.</p>

        <h3 class="titleBox">intelligence gathering</h3>

        <p class="textBox">Aerial reconnaissance with the objective of collection of imagery intelligence, signals intelligence, as well as measurement and signature intelligence. intelligence gathering has also enabled some aircraft and UAVs to carry out real-time surveillance in addition to general intelligence gathering.</p>

        <h3 class="titleBox">battlespace management</h3>

        <p class="textBox">the adaptive means and measures that enable the dynamic synchronization of air activities, as military forces realize effects across an expanding volume of the battlespace, the potential for interference between aircraft, increases</p>
        <h3 class="titleBox">transport functions</h3>

        <p class="textBox">Also called airlifting, consists of two distinct types: strategic and tactical. Typically, strategic airlifting involves moving material long distances, whereas a tactical airlift focuses on deploying resources and material into a specific location with high precision.</p>

                <p class="textBox">The first military uses of aviation involved lighter-than-air balloons. During the Battle of Fleurus in 1794, the French observation balloon l&#39;Entreprenant was used to monitor Austrian troop movements. The use of lighter-than-air aircraft in warfare became prevalent in the 19th century, including regular use in the American Civil War. Lighter-than-air military aviation persisted until shortly after World War II, gradually being withdrawn from various roles as heavier-than-air aircraft improved.</p>

                <h4>Heavier-than-air</h4>
                <p>
                    Heavier-than-air aircraft were recognized as having military applications early on, despite resistance from traditionalists and the severe limitations of early aircraft.
                    The U.S. Army Signal Corps purchased a Wright Model A on 2 August 1909 which became the first military aircraft in history.

                    In 1911, the Italians used a variety of aircraft types in reconnaissance, photo-reconnaissance, and bombing roles during the Italo-Turkish War.
                    On October 23, 1911, an Italian pilot, Captain Carlo Piazza, flew over Turkish lines on the world&#39;s first aerial reconnaissance mission, and on November 1, the first-ever aerial bomb was dropped by Sottotenente Giulio Gavotte, on Turkish troops in Libya, from an early model of Etrich Taube aircraft.
                    The Turks, lacking anti-aircraft weapons, were the first to shoot down an airplane by rifle fire.
                    The earliest military role filled by aircraft was reconnaissance, however, by the end of World War I, military aviation had rapidly embraced many specialized roles, such as artillery spotting, air superiority, bombing, ground attack, and anti-submarine patrols.
                    Technological improvements were made at a frenzied pace, and the first all-metal cantilevered airplanes were going into service as the war ended.

            <p>Between the major world wars incremental improvements made in many areas, especially powerplants, aerodynamics, structures, and weapons, led to an even more rapid advance in aircraft technology during World War II, with large performance increases and the introduction of aircraft into new roles, including Airborne Early Warning, electronic warfare, weather reconnaissance, and flying lifeboats. Great Britain used aircraft to suppress revolts throughout the Empire during the interwar period and introduced the first military transports, which revolutionized logistics, allowing troops and supplies to be quickly delivered over vastly greater distances.</p>

                While they first appeared during World War I, ground-attack aircraft didn&#39;t provide a decisive contribution until the Germans introduced Blitzkrieg during the Invasion of Poland and Battle of France, where aircraft functioned as mobile flying artillery to quickly disrupt defensive formations. The Allies would later use rocket-equipped fighters in the same role, immobilizing German armored divisions during the Battle of Normandy and afterward. World War I also saw the creation of the first strategic bomber units, however, they wouldn&#39;t be tested until the Spanish Civil War when the perceived effects of mass bombardment would encourage their widespread use during World War II. Carrier aviation also first appeared during World War I, and likewise came to play a major role during World War II, with most major navies recognizing the aircraft carrier&#39;s advantages over the battleship and devoting massive resources to the building of new carriers.
            </p>
            <h4>World war II</h4>
            <p>During World War II, U-boats threatened the ability of the Allies to transport troops and war materiel to Europe, spurring the development of very long-range Maritime patrol aircraft, whose capability of independently detecting and destroying submerged submarines was greatly increased with new detection systems, including sonobuoys, Leigh Lights, and radar, along with better weapons including homing torpedoes and improved depth charges. This played a major role in winning the Battle of the Atlantic. Aircraft also played a much-expanded role, with many notable engagements being decided solely through the use of military aircraft, such as the Battle of Britain or the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the conclusion of the Pacific War against Japan was marked by two lone aircraft dropping the atomic bombs, devastating the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The introduction of the jet engine, radar, early missiles, helicopters, and computers are World War II advancements that are felt to the present day.</p>

        <h3 id="coldWar" class="titleBox">Cold war</h3>
        <p class="textBox">Post World War II, the development of military aviation was spurred by the Cold War stand-off between the superpowers. The helicopter appeared late in World War II and matured into an indispensable part of military aviation, transporting troops and providing expanded anti-submarine capabilities to smaller warships, negating the need for large numbers of small carriers. The need to out-perform opponents pushed new technology and aircraft developments in the U.S.S.R. and the United States, among others, and the Korean War and the Vietnam War tested the resulting designs. Incredible advances in electronics were made, starting with the first electronic computers during World War II and steadily expanding from its original role of cryptography into communications, data processing, reconnaissance, remotely piloted aircraft, and many other roles until it has become an integral aspect of modern warfare. In the early 1960s, missiles were expected to replace manned interceptors and guns in other manned aircraft. They failed to live up to expectations as surface-to-air missiles lacked flexibility and were not as effective as manned interceptors, and fighters equipped only with air-to-air missiles had limited effectiveness against opposing aircraft which could avoid being hit. Missiles were also expensive, especially against low-value ground targets. The 1970s saw the return of the gun-armed fighter, and a greater emphasis on maneuverability. The 1980s through to the present day were characterized by stealth technology and other countermeasures.</p>
